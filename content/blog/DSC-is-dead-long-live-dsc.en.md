Is DSC really dead? In this PSConfEU session, Michael and Gael address the most common questions about Desired State Configuration, its current state, and where the future might be heading with Guest Configuration and Azure Arc.

The main points we wanted to cover in this session are what the current situation was, answer some questions, and show you where the future might be.
We know that if you're following what the DSC Community and maybe joined one of our Community call, you must have heard a good chunk.

This is an attempt to address the questions we hear the most, regardless of your knowledge -or lack of- in the DSC technology, Configuration Management or Infrastructure as Code.

We wanted to clear up some misunderstanding, present the humans behind the [DSC Community Committee](/community/committee/), and explain how the technology may relate to your job and your future. You can read more details about [the Origin Story online](/origin-story/).

I hope that another time we will be able to introduce the [DSC Community Maintainers](/community/maintainers/), and show the awesome work they're doing, and how you can help them!

If you still have unanswered questions, we would love to hear them.
You'll find us on the [PowerShell slack](https://aka.ms/psslack) or Discord, in the DSC channel.

Check our [Help](/help/) for more info.
