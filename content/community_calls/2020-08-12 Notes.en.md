1. Next Community Call (September)
   1. [Steve Lee](https://github.com/SteveL-MSFT) makes a guest appearance to
      discuss the proposal regarding [changes to DSC resource platform](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13359).
      Highlights below:
      - Proposing to move to JSON instead of MOF (considered for PowerShell 7.1)
      - Windows PowerShell LCM is unchanged (will only support MOF).
      - Resource will need both a mof and json schema to work cross-PowerShell-versions.
