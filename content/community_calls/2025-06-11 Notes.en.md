- Define PSDSC method signatures: Mikey created a [proposal](https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/issues/860) on the DSC repository for PSDSC method signatures.
- Python DSC v3 resource: The TSToy already has a Go DSC v3 sample. Currently, the resource has a draft open, converting it to a [Python](https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC-Samples/pull/26).
- New releases: DSC v3.1.0-rc.1 was released. Steve explained the lifecycle of releases, and wants to bring out a new GA release soon.
- Bicep extension and Bicep types: Bicep contains an experimental feature that can be turned on in the `.bicepconfig.json`. This allows for converting Bicep to ARM, which can be picked up by `dsc.exe. Andy Lee Jordan from the PowerShell team also started a concept on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/bicep-types-dsc).
