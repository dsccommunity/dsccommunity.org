- Raimund Andree presents: Test-DscParameterState
  - Some resources have a huge overlap in Test() and Get() which is a pain for maintenance and testing. The SharePointDsc resource was the first that started with a generic way to compare the current with the desired state. This pattern has been extended and covers almost any type now: string, int, scriptblock, hashtable, CimInstance and PSCredential. Want to do a reverse check as well or handle sorting? Then letâ€™s have a look at Test-DscParameterState.
