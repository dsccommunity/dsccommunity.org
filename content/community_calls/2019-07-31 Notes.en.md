#### Invoke-DscResource RFC

See the RFC here https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/214

#### Transferring repositories & PS Gallery Packages

Transfer of the repositories will be made in a way so that we keep the
quality and still be secure, and will probably start with the move of
UpdateServicesDsc.

These topics and more can be discussed again on the next community call,
or discuss it in the **Virtual PowerShell User Group** _#DSC_ channel.
For information on how to join, see https://dsccommunity.org/community/contact/

#### Leaving PowerShell 4.0 support

It is not a problem leaving PowerShell 4.0 support. It is up to each maintainer
if they want to leave PowerShell 4.0.

#### Automating releases

General consensus was that more frequent releases. Breaking Changes
should be handled by semver.
There was interest from the community to help build pipelines.
