<!-- ### How to find HerShell Pub

In PSWorld, walk (take your avatar) to the HerShell Pub. The pub is in the middle of the map (you can use the mouse scroll-wheel to see the whole map).

Inside the pub, mingle. When it is time for the DSC Community call go to track 3 (the door to the right, between the British flags) and take a seat.
Presenters go to the podium on the stage. Once at the podium the presenter will automatically broadcast to everyone.

If your avatar spawn in the PSConf EU MiniCon, then go outside (move down on the map). Once outside exit through the grey door so you get out of the construction area, now you are in PSWorld.
