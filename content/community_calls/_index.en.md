### Community Call Agenda

To the left you find the next agenda and the previous community call notes
from what has been discussed.
Please feel free to send in PR's to add items you feel need to be discussed
to the agenda for the next community call.

>The file to update for new agenda items is [`content/community_calls/next_call.en.md`](https://github.com/dsccommunity/dsccommunity.org/blob/master/content/community_calls/next_call.en.md)

### Add next community call agenda and update notes to the web site

Make sure after the call that the agenda (next_call.en.md) is renamed
appropriately, and the `weight: 99x` decremented from the last notes.

Then run the command below to create a new file under `content/community_calls`.

```bash
hugo new community_calls/next_call.en.md
```
