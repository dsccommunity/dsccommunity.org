## Agenda

#### Community presentation

**YAML DSC v3 Completion Provider Extension** by Andrew Menagarishvili

#### DSC v3 Development and Features:

Mikey discussed the development of DSC v3, emphasizing its flexibility, such as allowing resources to be written in any language and improving integration with other tools. The goal is to make configuration definitions more vendor-agnostic and accessible 1.
The removal of the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) and the shift towards a tool-agnostic approach were highlighted as significant changes in DSC v3 2.
Challenges include ensuring comprehensive documentation and community understanding of the new features and migration paths from previous versions.

Integration with Other Tools:
The potential for DSC v3 to integrate with a wide range of tools, including Ansible, Chef, and Puppet, was discussed. This integration aims to leverage DSC v3's capabilities across different platforms and toolchains.
A challenge mentioned is the need for clear guidance and examples on how to achieve this integration effectively.

Resource Authoring and Migration:
Mikey encouraged resource authors to consider migrating to class-based resources to take advantage of DSC v3's new features.
The challenge here is the need for detailed migration guides and support for authors to transition their resources to the new model.
