## Agenda

## Call attendance

Attendance for the DSC Community call has been inconsistent.
A proposal was raised to merge the DSC call into the broader PowerShell Community call to reach a larger audience.
The trade-off: DSC would get more visibility, but discussions would be shorter.

Alpha 5 of DSC v3 is available with updated reference docs and a changelog by Mikey. There's also a new `Export` command to retrieve all instances of a DSC resource (useful for limited, structured resources like App Pools or Users).

Lastly, a discussion on managing reboots and elevation requirements have started. The following [issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/issues/50) has been created on GitHub.
