### Agenda

#### Main Session: Guest Configuration

Michael Greene, Program Manager for Azure Policy Guest Configuration, and
Gael Colas will present what Guest Configuration is, and what you can do

In this presentation we'll demo ways you can create your own packages
leveraging DSC Resources, test them whether on Windows or Linux, and see
how you can use them through Azure Policy.
