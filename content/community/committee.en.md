The following is an explanation of what the DSC Committee is attempting to help
with, and how we are trying to help the community.

[Come and chat with us](/community/contact/) if you would like to discuss how
we can improve and build a better community!

**Katie** is the **owner of the Resource Kit at Microsoft** and has steered
its direction over the years. She is also an active member of the Engineering
team at Microsoft looking after all things DSC as well as
[Azure Guest Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration),
and can bridge the communication between the new products and features
leveraging DSC and the DSC Community.

**Michael** is a long time contributor to the DSC Resource Kit, and the
**Program Manager** for [Azure Guest Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration).
He is well positioned to translate customer needs and requirements back to the
community, or from the community back to Microsoft, as well as share the
position or direction that is being taken internally.

**Daniel** has been a long time contributor to the DSC Resource Kit, and if you
had anything to do on the GitHub repository, you most likely have came across
his work. Not only he is maintaining a few High Quality Resource Module, he
consistently produces a massive efforts to help review other Pull Request and
improve the testing and quality of the Resource Kit.

**Johan** is also a top contributor and maintains some of the most actives
Resources, while joining Daniel in reviewing code across all other repositories
and improving the experience and quality of the DSC Resource Kit. Johan also
helps new contributors and maintainers to get up to speed, and any DSC user in
the [Slack PowerShell #DSC channel](/community/contact/)

**Gael** has been a long time contributor to the DevOps and automation field.
Gael works as an cloud and automation consultant and makes many appearances
on various conferences as a speaker where he passionately talks about DevOps
and automation. This have awarded him Microsoft MVP for many years. Gael
also organizing conferences and have been the main advocate for making
the DSC Community separate from Microsoft.

## The Decision Process

The DSC committee is a steering committee that **makes decisions** affecting
the organization and the DSC Resources it owns, **after consulting the community**
of maintainers, contributors and users.

The goal of this organization and new approach is to avoid being blocked by the
lack of availability of one of its members.

To do so, requests should be suggested in writing to the **DSC Community RFC**
repository of the **DSC Community** GitHub organization, and **can** be
considered approved 72 hours after submission
**unless someone objected explicitly**
(i.e. "_I Object this decision ... [unless|until]..._"), or **requested a change**
in a PR review.

Some specific exceptions to this system will apply and be listed as we evolve,
such as the eviction of a Member requiring an active Majority (or something
similar to be discussed).

## Appointing the initial Committee

Although we want the election process to evolve and be more open over time, the
initial committee is appointed based on contributions to the DSC Community and
the DSC Resource Kit.

There are a few reasons why we opted to appoint the initial members instead of
creating an election process. Although the DSC Community Organization is new,
it is a continuation of the ideas and spirit of the DSC Resource Kit, in a more
flexible format.

We want the transition to be swift and smooth, and we did not want to struggle
with an election process, as the community is not yet organized for this approach,
or for a large committee that increases side communication and delays.

The DSC Resource Kit was already operating under similar structure, but it wasn't
official or formalized, and Johan and Daniel were not given enough GitHub
permissions to have smooth and bottleneck-free administration.
