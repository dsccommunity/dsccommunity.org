## Welcome to the DSC Community

Welcome to the DSC Community portal where we share what's happening in the DSC community,
and how we are organizing ourselves.

First of all, **we have no affiliation to Microsoft** and do not represent
the company in any way, shape or form. **Opinions are our own**.

We're an **independent community**—users, contributors, maintainers—working closely
with Microsoft for the benefit of the DSC Community, and many members
happen to be working for Microsoft.

## What you'll find here

In this section, you will find information about:

- How we got there
- The steering committee
- the amazing maintainers
- Where to ask a question
- What we plan and why
- How you can contribute

If any documentation about the DSC community is missing, excluding information
for the [DSC framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview/overview)
or other related [solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration),
have a look at the [help](/help/), or feel free to raise an issue
in [this website's GitHub project](https://github.com/dsccommunity/dsccommunity.org/issues).
