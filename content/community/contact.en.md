#### The #DSC Channel

The community gathers in the **Virtual PowerShell User Group** _#DSC_ channel,
which is an open & instant messaging chat room for all DSC related questions,
discussions, and collaboration.

The PowerShell channels are bridged between Discord and Slack, so you
can use either service, via the apps or websites.

The **Virtual PowerShell User Group** contains more than just the _#DSC_
channel: there are also channels covering topics related to PowerShell,
DevOps as well as many other and practices and technologies, so you
may also join them too.

You can read more about the **Virtual PowerShell User Group** and how to
connect at the site [poshcode.org](http://poshcode.org/). The buttons below
are two of the most popular ways to connect.

> *Tagging a specific user so they get notified works best in the app
