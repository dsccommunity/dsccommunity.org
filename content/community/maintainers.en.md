Here is a list of the current maintainers of DSC modules in the DSC Community.
If you wish to be a maintainer in a module, then please contact a maintainer
of the module or a member of the committee. If you are a maintainer and feel
you no longer have the time to put in and want to stop being maintainer
then please send in a PR to update this list, or contact a member of the
committee.

_People on this list are added and removed manually, but the information_
_for each individual is collected from their public GitHub profile page._
_This list is sorted by GitHub account name._
