Despite the few "[DSC Planning Updates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/?s=DSC+Planning&submit=%EE%9C%A1)"
written by Michael Greene (Program Manager for DSC, and DSC Community Committee
member), there are still misunderstandings by the community with regards to the
directions Microsoft is taking for DSC and its ecosystem.

Here, we'll try to explain what **we** understand from the DSC Community.

## Former plans & realignment

Microsoft's DSC Team, about a year and an half ago, was working
on a new version of the LCM component of the DSC Platform.

They were thinking they would open-source it shortly after, as you can judge
from the DSC Planning update of the time, or optimistic sessions delivered
by the teams. They labelled, confusingly, the work a new DSC, or DSC Core,
before rectifying some of this communication.




## No plan for DSCvNext

- There's an DSC LCMv2 written for Azure Policy Guest Configuration.
- There are no further plans for a new DSC Pull Server.
