Despite the few "[DSC Planning Updates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/?s=DSC+Planning&submit=%EE%9C%A1)"
written by Michael Greene (Program Manager for DSC, and DSC Community Committee
member), there are still misunderstandings by the community with regards to the

- There are no further plans for a new DSC Pull Server.
