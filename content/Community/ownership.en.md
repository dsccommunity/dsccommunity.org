## Goal and purpose

<img src="../../images/DSC_Logo_300p.png" alt="drawing" style="width:200px; display:block; float: right; margin-left: auto;margin-right:0;"/>

Previously owned by the DSC Team, and more specifically by [Katie](https://github.com/kwirkykat), the DSC Resources are now owned by [the DSC Community](https://github.com/dsccommunity): a collective of **Open Source maintainers** getting together to **improve the Resources**, their **quality** and the **practices** around DSC.


The main purpose is to handle better the increased community contributions, and remove hindrance to improvements by spreading the load on a Committee, and giving more privileges to the maintainers.

## Context

Initially, when DSC was new and the DSC Resource kit relatively small, it was possible for the DSC Team at Microsoft to handle the maintenance and releases of the DSC Resources part of the DSC Resource Kit.

But the community has outgrown the capacity of the DSC team, while the latter is taking on more work with the new Azure Guest Configuration.

The DSC Resources from the Resource Kit that were hosted under the PowerShell Team GitHub organization did not allow for external (non-Microsoft) contributors to be members of the organization, or given extra permissions beside what `external collaborators` allowed.

## Committee and Teams

By using its own GitHub Organization outside of Microsoft's ownership, the DSC Community can be steered by a committee where its members&mdash;including people not employed by Microsoft&mdash;have full control over the GitHub Organization.

For now, [the committee](../committee) is composed of Katie, Michael, Daniel & Johann, long time contributors and driving force of the DSC Resource Kit. This is formalizing what happened for a couple of years with the DSC Resource Kit.

Another benefit of having a GitHub organization is that we can create teams, such as the Committee team and the Maintainer Team, that you can mention in issues or discussions and give permissions to, and add someone from that team to manage the members.
