## Welcome to the DSC Community

Welcome to the DSC Community portal where we share who is behind the community and how we try to organize ourselves.


In this section, you will find information about:

- The steering committee
- The best place to find help
- How to ask a question
- How you can contribute
- Where to look for documentation

If any documentation about the DSC community is missing, excluding information for the
[DSC framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview/overview) or
other related [solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration),
please feel free to raise an issue in [this website's GitHub project](https://github.com/dsccommunity/dsccommunity.org/issues).
