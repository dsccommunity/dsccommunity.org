## Agenda

#### Community presentation

**"WinGet and DSC Resources"** presented by Demetrius Nelon.

#### Discussion

The discussion covered updates on DSC V3, upcoming community calls, and efforts around Winget configuration. There was talk about upcoming events like the PowerShell DevOps Global Summit and PSConfEU, where more details on DSC V3 and Winget will be shared.

A major highlight was the announcement of open-sourcing some DSC resources from the Winget team. They've been working on using Winget as a Local Configuration Manager (LCM) and adding more DSC resources, including ones for Python, Git, Yarn, and Windows settings. These will eventually move to the DSC community. There’s also ongoing work to improve discoverability and best practices for DSC resources.

Winget configuration is evolving as a tool to help set up development environments, but there's also growing interest in using it for governance and enterprise scenarios. The team is working on better integration with PowerShell, private galleries, and dependency management. Winget will be included in Windows Server previews, making it easier to set up environments, although PowerShell 7 still isn’t included by default.
