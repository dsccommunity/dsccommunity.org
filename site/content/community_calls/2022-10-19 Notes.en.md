### Agenda

#### Community Presentation

- Constantin Hager: Azure Automation DSC and the Azure VM DSC Extension. How do they work together?

In this presentation you will see how to deploy Azure Automation State configuration (DSC).
We will deploy DSC Configurations and assign them to Azure VMs .
I will also show how you can deploy a DSC Configuration without Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC).

Everything will all happen with Azure DevOps and a CI / CD Process.
